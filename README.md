This is the official Pytorch implementation of "Local and Global Feature Aggregation-Aware Network for Salient Object Detection" [Paper](https://www.baidu.com/)

(Noting: Currently only the model code is shown, the complete project and the weights after training will be added later.)

## Prerequisites

- visdom 0.1.8.9
- Python 3.7.4
